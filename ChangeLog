    The maximum possible value of the NSS is MAX_VHT_NSS, so allow a value

    Fill in our port information using StringCchPrintf on Windows instead
    of g_snprintf. Loading a large-ish test capture here under the VS 2013
    profiler showed that we spent 620 samples in col_append_ports. Switching
    from g_snprintf to StringCchPrintf reduced that to six samples.

    Handle dissectors that don't have names.
    
    Dissector handles created with create_dissector_handle() don't have a
    name; report them as "(anonymous)" (there's no guarantee that the printf
    family of routines don't crash when a null pointer is provided to %s -
    the printf routines in at least some versions of Solaris *do* crash in
    that case).

    ceph: distingush between client and server by checking for a second entity_addr_t
    
    The current ceph dissector assumes that the server will always send its
    initial connection negotiation first, but that's not necessarily the
    case, especially with the kernel client which sends its banner as soon
    as the socket is created.
    
    So, we need a better mechanism to determine which end is client and
    which is the server. The server sends its own address and then the
    address of the client, but the client only sends its own address. We
    can determine whether the initial negotiation message is from the client
    or server by looking at the data after the first entity addr and seeing
    whether it also looks like an entity addr.
    
    This patch takes that approach. It just grabs the address family from
    the second address and sees whether it's IPv4 or IPv6. If it's not one
    of those, then it assumes that it's not an entity_addr_t at all and is
    therefore a request from the client.
    
    We could go farther and try to verify the port and address as well, but
    that's probably overkill. The address family is at the same offset as
    the host_type field in the client's Connect request, but it's big endian
    and the host_type is little endian. As long as we don't end up with
    host_types that are 0x200 or 0xA00, this scheme should be OK.

    Cleanup and extend the regex for matching expert info entries.
    
    Match each entity in the structure explicitly rather than skipping a bunch at
    the end.  This makes it possible to easily (and clearly) specify where we
    allow white space.
    
    Don't capture the event group and severity: we don't use them anyway.
    
    Don't put single character matches in []: that makes it hard to read (for
    me anyway).
    
    There's no need for both the "m"(ultiline) and "s"(ingle line) options.  Nor
    the "o"optimize (make buggy) option.
    
    These same changes should/will be applied to the hf regex later.

    Treat libssh specially - for some reason, when built by macosx-setup.sh
    (which just does a standard cmake build of libssh), libssh's shared
    library has just libssh.4.dylib, not {installation
    directory}/libssh.4.dylib, as its shared library ID, so we don't find
    its binary using otool -L.

    APRS: register the storm fields.
    
    There's been a comment here since 2012 about them being unregistered.  Put in
    some registrations based on a feeble understanding of the specification (these
    are all strings, add them as such); that should be close enough and is much
    better than the (dissector) assertion we'd get otherwise.
    
    Don't bother putting those hf's in a global structure and passing around the
    structure: the hf's are global anyway--just reference them directly.
    
    Add a link to the specification while we're here.

    The Prefix64 option requires that the prefix length be <= 12, and, if

    Check to make sure that it is <= 12.
    
    While we're at it, use proto_tree_add_item_ret_uint(), update IETF

    NHRP: Add option for source address in authentication extension.
    
    It seems that not all Cisco IOS implementations adhere to RFC2332
    with respect to having the source address after the SPI in the
    authentication extension. This change adds a preference to suppress
    the interpretation of the bytes following the SPI as the source
    address. The default is to adhere to the RFC.

    wslua: fail on tree:add(nil)
    
    It is unlikely that tree:add(nil) or tree:add(nil, tvb) represents a
    valid invocation. Most likely the developer made a mistake and tried
    something like:
    
        local pf_thing = ProtoField.string("some.thing", "Description")
        some_proto.fields = { pf_thing }
        ...
            tree:add(some_proto.fields.thing, tvb())
    
    which should have been:
    
        some_proto.fields = { thing = pf_thing }
    
    or:
    
            tree:add(pf_thing, tvb())
    
    Save the developer some pain and bail out early.

    fix missing fields for json, ek and pdml when used with -e fields
    
    
    Description:
    
    when -T json,ed or pdml used in conjunction with -e fields they would
    always miss  the last field.
    
    in case of json and ek, if some fields in the middle are empty,
    the generated json would be invalid.
    
    sample for ek:
    
     {  "_index": "packets-2016-06-30",  "_type": "pcap_file",
     "_score": null,  "_source":
     {  "layers": {  "e212.mcc": ["255","262"]  "frame.time_epoch":
     ["1426550400.004751510"],  "e212.mnc": ["1","1"]  }  }  }
    
    command:
    
    tshark -T ek -r C:\a.pcap -e e212.mcc -e frame.comment
    -e frame.time_epoch -e e212.mnc > C:\test.json
    
    note:
    
    the comma is missing between e212.mcc and frame.time_epoch

    ASN.1 dissectors - don't try to find yourself.
    
    If an ASN.1 dissector is calling register_dissector for itself in its proto_register_xxx
    function and then calling find_dissector for itself in its proto_reg_handoff_xxx
    function then just create a static handle for that dissector and use the return
    value of register_dissector, so the find isn't necessary.

    remove Wireshark.pro, modify update-tx accordingly
    
    Wireshark.pro is the qt project file used by qmake
    which in turn was used by nmake
    
    now that nmake is gone, the only reason to keep Wireshark.pro
    was the update-tx script that syncs our translation files with Transifex
    
    update-tx calls lupdate to create a list of texts to translate and
    lrelease to convert such a list into a binary file
    lupdate and lrelase can read file names from a project file or
    get them on the command line
    
    modify update-tx to pass the required file names on the command line
    we can use wildcards so there's no need to change update-tx when a new
    source file is added
    
    remove Wireshark.pro from the release tarball as well

    test: ensure temporary directory outside source tree
    
    The whole point of using mktemp is to get a temporary directory outside
    the source tree. Commit v2.1.0rc0-1027-ge01f8fb tried to fix the
    invocation for *BSD (including OS X), but by adding a template it
    dropped the implicit --tmpdir option for GNU mktemp on Linux..
    
    Use the GNU mktemp invocation and if it fails (for example, because a
    template is expected for BSD/OS X), provide a template.

    non-zero NSS values or not, and use the per-user NSS value to decide
    whether a particular bit in the bitmask is valid and worth displaying.
    
    Make the four coding fields bitfields, with the appropriate bit.

    Increase MAX_DISSECTOR_ADDR_TYPE.
    
    With the recent changes causing some address types to be registered
    by their proper dissectors, I ran into the MAX_DISSECTOR_ADDR_TYPE
    limit in a new dissector I'm currently writing.

    Qt: Use queued signals+slots for filter actions
    
    Many of our dialogs can send an "apply this display filter" signal to
    the main window. Applying a display filter in turn creates a nested
    event loop via cf_read+update_progress_dlg. If the "apply" signal+slot
    is directly connected (which is the default, and which means we're
    calling into a function table) we can close the dialog while the signal
    is firing, which means we return into a deleted object.
    
    Make all of the filterAction signals+slots queued instead of direct.

    Add address_to_bytes API.
    
    This will copy an address's "byte format" into a buffer.  The original
    intended design is for export_pdu functionality, which tries to do
    this "manually" for many address types (and creates undesired dependencies)
    
    The default functionality if a "byte format function" isn't provided
    (currently the case for all address types) is a memcpy of the address
    data.  Providing "address to byte" functions to aid export PDU
    functionality will be provided later.

    Npcap decided not to add "C:\Windows\System32\Npcap" to

    cmake: add PIDL dissector generation support
    
    The dissectors list is generated based on regex magic on pidl/Makefile.
    A dssetup.cnf file is added because all other protocols already have
    this file. The srvsvc and wkssvc protocols cannot be built for some
    reason, so just disable it (this mirrors the original Makefile).
    
    Add frsrpc and samr to PIDL_DISSECTOR_SRC list which was missing
    compared to autotools.
    
    Tested with an out-of-tree and in-tree build with cmake (make and ninja):
    
        cmake -GNinja && ninja -v pidl-dissectors
        touch epan/dissectors/pidl/dfs/dfs.idl && ninja generate_dissector-dcerpc-dfs
        cmake . && make -C epan/dissectors/pidl generate_dissector-dcerpc-dfs

    ssh: packets after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS are encrypted
    
    According to RFC 4253 section 7.3, once the SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS is received
    all packets after that will be encrypted using the negotiated keys. This
    can happen in the middle of a frame, so account for the offset in the
    frame where this happens.

    Pass "/utf-8" to Visual C++ 2015.
    
    Many projects (Qt[1] and GNOME[2] in particular) either recommend, use,
    or at least allow for UTF-8 in source and header files. Pass /utf-8 to
    Visual C++ 2015 so that it will behave itself around UTF-8 and be more
    like that nice compiler down the street.

    cmake: fix ENABLE_ASAN detection
    
    Do not add -fsanitize=undefined when ASAN is requested, UBSAN is a
    different feature (which could be added later as desired). This makes
    the -DENABLE_ASAN=1 option match the autotools --enable-asan option.
    
    Fail hard if ASAN support is requested but not supported, this avoids
    surprises when something is wrong. Fix ASAN detection by setting the
    linker option too.
    
    Note: if you have previously set ENABLE_ASAN=1 with the broken ASAN
    detection, you have to clear your CMakeCache.txt file to redo the
    detection.

Date:   Mon Jun 13 15:28:16 2016 -0400

    Change how dissectors do late-field-registration to avoid a double-registration
    assertion.
    
    If a dissector forces registration of fields during dissection it needs to do
    so in a way that clears the prefix registration.  Otherwise epan will call the
    registration routine a 2nd time (which will cause us to assert out) if a user
    types a display filter (with the dissector's prefix) that doesn't exist.
    
    Update the proto_register_prefix() comments to reflect this.

    dcerpc: don't THROW() an exception from a dissector
    
    remove the checks in dissect_ndr_ucarray_core() where a block or bytes
    dissection function is called and an exception is thrown if the offset
    wraps around, i.e. the final offset is lower than the initial one
    
    the block functions eventually call proto_tree_add_item(), which throws
    an exception if necessary
    
    the bytes functions end up calling functions to dissect basic types.
    insert calls to tvb_ensure_bytes_exist() if those functions increase our
    offset without reading data.  thus, an exception is thrown if there's an
    overflow.
    
    remove some unnecessary if (tree) checks while at it

    if we do an out-of-tree build with cmake and the source directory

    Convert AT_SS7PC to a "dissector address type"
    
    The formatting of the address type is determined by a preference in
    packet-mtp3.c, so just make MTP3 register the address type.
    Use address_type_get_by_name in other dissectors (and export_pdu)
    to use the address type.

    Qt: Make the capture filter read-only only in main welcome.
    
    As noted in gb7897dd, CaptureFilterCombo needs to be read-only until the
    app is initialized. Move the code to do so to MainWelcome, otherwise the
    capture filter entry in CaptureInterfacesDialog starts out read-only and
    stays that way. Disable / enable the entire CaptureFilterCombo instead
    of setting its lineEdit read-only status, which provides a stronger
    visual indicator.

    Actually progress through the command data (CID-281394)
    
    The loop reading through the command data doesn't progress through
    it, it just reads until the available data (represented by max_length)
    runs out. It therefore:
    - doesn't present the commands
    - doesn't detect a missing final marker bit (CID-281394)

    Move Gateway Control Protocol (Context Tracking) into packet-h248.h
    
    The Gateway Control Protocol (Context Tracking) is used by both H248
    and MEGACO, so the functionality was refactored to epan, but should
    really be kept in the dissector directory to minimize (and eventually
    completely remove) the epan directory's dependence on it.

    When comparing addresses for equality, just make sure the types are the
    same, the lengths are the same and, if the lengths are non-zero, the
    data is the same; don't treat AT_NONE specially - the "lengths are
    non-zero" check will make sure we do the right thing.

    Qt/Bluetooth: Add Device dialog
    
    Device dialog appears when user double clicks on device in
    Devices dialog (Bluetooth->Devices). It provides
    summary of device, like BD_ADDR, name, timeouts, etc.
    Base on information from HCI layer, so this feature is more interesting
    for local devices (capturing on its side). Each field has changes counter,
    what mean that value at specified field changes in time, for example:
    user change device name 3 times. Please note that initial change
    is not counted. It means that you can see fielkd without any value
    then change occur and counter is not increased. It will be increased
    next time. Reason for that is in most cases field value is unknown
    at start.

    see IDBs of a different type in the future, so don't check for
    per-packet encapsulation before counting packets of the encapsulation
    type.

    Use the locale's decimal separator for times as seconds and fraction.
    
    We use it when printing *other* seconds-and-fraction values, as we're
    just using %f, so we should use it consistently.  If you don't want
    commas as decimal separators, you presumably don't want them anywhere;
    if you want to standardize the way numbers are shown, set the locale to
    the C locale.
    
    This addresses one of the two problems mentioned in bug 12500; there may
    be other places in the Wireshark suite where we should use the locale's
    decimal separator in times.
