                         Wireshark 2.1.1 Release Notes

   This is a semi-experimental release intended to test new features for
   Wireshark 2.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
   used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

What's New

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 2.1.0:
     * Added -d option for Decode As support in Wireshark (mimics TShark
       functionality)
     * The Qt UI, GTK+ UI, and TShark can now export packets as JSON.
       TShark can additionally export packets as Elasticsearch-compatible
       JSON.
     * The Qt UI now supports the -j, -J, and -l flags. The -m flag is now
       deprecated.
     * The Conversations and Endpoints dialogs are more responsive when
       viewing large numbers of items.
     * The RTP player now allows up to 30 minutes of silence frames.
     * Packet bytes can now be displayed as EBCDIC.
     * The Qt UI loads captures faster on Windows.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 2.0.0:
     * The intelligent scroll bar now sits to the left of a normal scroll
       bar and provides a clickable map of nearby packets.
     * You can now switch between between Capture and File Format
       dissection of the current capture file via the View menu in the Qt
       GUI.
     * You can now show selected packet bytes as ASCII, HTML, Image, ISO
       8859-1, Raw, UTF-8, a C array, or YAML.
     * You can now use regular expressions in Find Packet and in the
       advanced preferences.
     * Name resolution for packet capture now supports asynchronous DNS
       lookups only. Therefore the "concurrent DNS resolution" preference
       has been deprecated and is a no-op. To enable DNS name resolution
       some build dependencies must be present (currently c-ares). If that
       is not the case DNS name resolution will be disabled (but other
       name resolution mechanisms, such as host files, are still
       available).
     * The byte under the mouse in the Packet Bytes pane is now
       highlighted.
     * TShark supports exporting PDUs via the -U flag.
     * The Windows and OS X installers now come with the "sshdump" and
       "ciscodump" extcap interfaces.
     * Most dialogs in the Qt UI now save their size and positions.
     * The Follow Stream dialog now supports UTF-16.
     * The Firewall ACL Rules dialog has returned.
     * The Flow (Sequence) Analysis dialog has been improved.
     * We no longer provide packages for 32-bit versions of OS X.
     * The Bluetooth Device details dialog has been added.

  New File Format Decoding Support

   Wireshark is able to display the format of some types of files (rather
   than displaying the contents of those files). This is useful when
   you're curious about, or debugging, a file and its format. To open a
   capture file (such as PCAP) in this mode specify "MIME Files Format" as
   the file's format in the Open File dialog.

   New files that Wireshark can open in this mode include:

  New Protocol Support

   Apache Cassandra - CQL version 3.0, Bachmann bluecom Protocol,
   Bluetooth Pseudoheader for BR/EDR, CISCO ERSPAN3 Marker, Edge Control
   Protocol (ECP), Ericsson IPOS Kernel Packet Header Dissector Added
   (IPOS), Extensible Control & Management Protocol (eCMP), FLEXRAY
   Protocol dissector added (automotive bus), IEEE 802.1BR E-Tag, ISO
   8583-1, ISO14443, ITU-T G.7041/Y.1303 Generic Framing Procedure (GFP),
   LAT protocol (DECNET), Metamako trailers, Network-Based IP Flow
   Mobility (NBIFOM), Nokia Intelligent Service Interface (ISI), Open
   Mobile Alliance Lightweight Machine to Machine TLV payload Added (LwM2M
   TLV), Real Time Location System (RTLS), RTI TCP Transport Layer
   (RTITCP), STANAG 5602 SIMPLE, USB3 Vision Protocol (USB machine vision
   cameras), USBIP Protocol, UserLog Protocol, and Zigbee Protocol
   Clusters Dissectors Added (Closures Lighting General Measurement &
   Sensing HVAC Security & Safety)

  Updated Protocol Support

   Bluetooth OBEX dissector (btobex) was renamed to Obex Dissector (obex),
   allow to DecodeAs it over USB, TCP and UDP.

   A preference was added to TCP dissector for handling IPFIX process
   information. It has been disabled by default.

  New and Updated Capture File Support

   and Micropross mplog

  New and Updated Capture Interfaces support

   Non-empty section placeholder.

  Major API Changes

   The libwireshark API has undergone some major changes:
     * The address macros (e.g., SET_ADDRESS) have been removed. Use the
       (lower case) functions of the same names instead.
     * "old style" dissector functions (that don't return number of bytes
       used) have been replaced in name with the "new style" dissector
       functions.
     * tvb_get_string and tvb_get_stringz have been replaced with
       tvb_get_string_enc and tvb_get_stringz_enc respectively.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   [1]https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be
   found on the [2]download page on the Wireshark web site.
     __________________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
   files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations
   vary from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the
   default locations on your system.
